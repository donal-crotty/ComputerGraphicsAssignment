# ComputerGraphicsAssignment
Computer Graphics Module Assignment from Final Year of Software Design (Cloud Computing). This assignment involved using Ray Tracing application POV-Ray to replicate images of random items which we had at our disposal.

This was a paired project along with another course colleague where we got to divide tasks between us and work as a team.
Please check the Wiki of this repo to find images of our project.
